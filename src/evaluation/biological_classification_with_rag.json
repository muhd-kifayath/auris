      "C": "Five Kingdom",
      "D": "Natural System"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "R.H. Whittaker's Five Kingdom classification organizes organisms based on cellular structure and mode of nutrition."

  {
    "question": "What characterizes organisms in the kingdom Monera?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Eukaryotic cells",
      "B": "Multicellular",
      "C": "Prokaryotic cells",
      "D": "Presence of a nucleus"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Monera consists of prokaryotic organisms, which lack a defined nucleus and include bacteria."

  {
    "question": "Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of Fungi?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Chitin in cell walls",
      "B": "Photosynthetic",
      "C": "Eukaryotic",
      "D": "Heterotrophic"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Fungi are heterotrophic and lack chlorophyll, thus they do not perform photosynthesis."

      "B": "Based on evolutionary relationships",
      "C": "Based on artificial traits",
      "D": "Based on habitat"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The phylogenetic system classifies organisms based on their evolutionary history and relationships."
